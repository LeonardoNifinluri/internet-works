                HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is a protocol – or a prescribed order and syntax for presenting information – used for transferring data over a network. HTTP requests are generated by a user's browser as the user interacts with web properties. 
            </p>
            <p>
               For example :  If a user clicks on a hyperlink, the browser will send a series of "HTTP GET" requests for the content that appears on that page. If someone Googles "What is HTTP?" and this article shows up in the search results, when they click on the link, their browser will create and send a series of HTTP requests in order to get the information necessary to render the page.
            </p>
            <p>What about HTTPS?</p>
            <p>
                The S in HTTPS stands for "secure." HTTPS uses TLS (or SSL) to encrypt HTTP requests and responses, so in the example above, instead of the text, the requests displayed using random characters
            </p>
            <p>
                HTTP messages are plaintext, which means unauthorized parties can easily access and read them over the internet. In contrast, HTTPS transmits all data in encrypted form. When users submit sensitive data, they can be confident that no third parties can intercept the data over the network.
